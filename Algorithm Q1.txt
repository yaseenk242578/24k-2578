1.	Input num1
2.	Input num2
3.	IF num1/num2 = any real number, print num2 is a divisor of num1.
4.	IF num1/num2 = any rational or decimal value or p/q form, PRINT num2 is not divisor of num1.
5.	Print answer.
6.	take a modulus to determine whether the answer is even or odd.
7.	IF the answer is a real number or a natural number, then verify if (answer%2==0) 
  print “This is an even number”, 
  Else “this number is odd”;
8.	IF the answer is rational or irrational or in p/q form, 
print “this number is neither even nor odd, this number contains a decimal value.”
9.	END.
