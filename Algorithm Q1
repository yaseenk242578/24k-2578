1.	Input num1
2.	Input num2
3.	IF num1/num2 = any real number, print num2 is a divisor of num1.
4.	IF num1/num2 = any rational or decimal value or p/q form, PRINT num2 is not divisor of num1.
5.	Print answer.
6.	To determine whether the answer is even or odd, take a modulus.
7.	IF answer is real number or natural number, then verify if (answer%2==0) 
  print “this is even number”, 
  Else “this number is odd”;
8.	IF answer is rational or irrational or in p/q form, 
print “this number is neither even nor odd, this number contains decimal value.”
9.	END.
